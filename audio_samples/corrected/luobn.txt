i	1
i	1

you	1
i	1
saw	1
that	1
clip	1
on	1
your	1
show	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
terrible	1
i	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
aggressive	1
i	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
traffic	1
signal	1
as	1
i	1
understand	1
it	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
gets	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
car	1
for	1
a	1
traffic	1

i	1
haven't	1
been	1
pulled	1
over	1
in	1
a	1
well	1
actually	1
but	1
seriously	1
who	1
get	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
just	1
looked	1
very	1
aggressive	1
i	1
didn't	1
like	1
his	1
demeanor	1
i	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
terrible	1
to	1
be	1
honest	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
i'm	1
a	1
huge	1
fan	1
of	1
the	1
police	1
i	1
think	1
the	1
police	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
back	1
power	1
but	1
this	1
guy	1
was	1
overly	1

to	0
your	0
i	1
hope	1
it	1
doesn't	1
but	1
it	1
might	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
relationship	1
with	1
african	1
americans	1
as	1
you	1
possibly	1
have	1
heard	1
i	1
just	1
have	1
great	1
respect	1
for	1
them	1
and	1
and	1
i	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
like	1
me	1
i	1
like	1
them	1
the	1
answer	1
is	1
it	1
possibly	1
does	1
it	1
shouldn't	1
and	1
it's	1
very	1
sad	1
if	1
the	1
cases	1
i	1
will	1
say	1
though	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
i	1
watch	1
that	1
so	1
close	1
i	1
watch	1
it	1
a	1
few	1
times	1
he	1
was	1
he	1
